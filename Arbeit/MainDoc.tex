\begin{abstract}
This paper depicts and evaluates different ways to ensure the integrity of a message in an MQTT environment since this is not provided by the MQTT protocol by default. 
The chosen options are Message Authentication Codes based on Hash-Functions using HMAC's, Message Authentication Codes based on Hash-Functions using Merkle Trees, Digital Signatures using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and JSON Web Signature. 
Each topic will be analysed in separate sections, to find out, which one is most suitable for achieving data integrity. 
In addition, each topic will include an example of how its presented solution has an impact on an MQTT packet. 
Apart from obvious factors like speed and security, one must not forget that MQTT can be used by all kinds of IoT-devices. 
As a result, one major aspect is also the suitability of each solution for devices with small memory and low processing speed. 
The analysis shows that the Elliptic Curve Curve25519 is most recommended to use for message integrity in an MQTT environment, due to its notable advantage over the other topics considering speed, while not performing worse concerning other relevant factors.
