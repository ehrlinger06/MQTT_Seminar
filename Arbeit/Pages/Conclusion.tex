\section{Conclusion}

Integrity is an very important aspect when it comes to exchanging messages. In this paper there were introduced three different algorithms to ensure integrity of the data in a MQTT environment and one framework to apply them. Alongside integrity all of them provide security meassures that make it harder for attackers to tamper the sent data. Also the implementation for all of these functions dont need much ressources ragarding the hardware, so they are greatly suitable for IoT networks and devices using MQTT. Like it is prescribed in the third chapter speed is a fundamental feature to warrant the security component. Regarding to the researches respective to speed, the Curve25519 algorithm stands clearly out as it is presented in the fifth chapter. Even if every aspect that has been discussed in each chapter is important, we deem the speed as the most meaningful one because there is the biggest difference in all of them. So we claim Digital Signatures using Elliptic Curve Cryptography as one of the strongest algorithm to assure integrity.
