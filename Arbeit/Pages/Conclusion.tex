\section{Conclusion}

Integrity is a very important aspect when it comes to exchanging messages. In this paper, three different algorithms were introduced to ensure integrity of the data in an MQTT environment and one framework to apply them. Alongside integrity all of them provide security measures that make it harder for attackers to tamper the sent data. Also the implementation for all of these functions doesn't need much resources ragarding the hardware, so they are greatly suitable for IoT networks and devices using MQTT. Like it is described in the third chapter speed is a fundamental feature to warrant the security component. Regarding the researches respective to speed, the Curve25519 algorithm clearly stands out as it is presented in the fifth chapter. Even though every aspect that has been discussed in each chapter is important, we deem the speed as the most meaningful one because there is the biggest difference in all of them. So we claim Digital Signatures using Elliptic Curve Cryptography as one of the strongest algorithm to assure integrity.
